Overview
-
This project implements several custom data structures and algorithms in Python, focusing on efficient memory management and performance. The core data structures include a dynamic array, doubly linked list, and bitvector, with algorithms designed to solve various computational problems.

Data Structures Implemented
-
- **Doubly Linked List**: Efficient manipulation of elements with O(1) access to both ends.
- **Dynamic Array**: Provides automatic resizing, supporting both append and prepend operations.
- **Bitvector**: Efficient space-saving structure for handling boolean data using bit-level operations.

Algorithmic Challenges
-
- **First Repeated Character**:
Finds the first repeated character in a string of up to 232 unique characters, utilising a custom data structure to track occurrences efficiently.

- **Sum of Missing Odd Integers**:
Computes the sum of missing odd integers in a range, given an unsorted list of integers. Uses custom structures to manage efficient range and integer operations.

- **Optimal Game Strategy**:
Solves a game where two players take turns removing numbers from a list, aiming to maximise their scores based on even or odd numbers. Implements strategic decision-making and optimised data handling.

- **Illumination of a Road**:
Determines the minimal radius needed to illuminate a road using a series of light poles placed at various points. This problem involves optimising coverage using the fewest resources possible.

These challenges are designed to test and demonstrate the practical use of custom data structures, including efficient memory handling and algorithm design.
