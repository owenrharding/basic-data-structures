Please CAREFULLY read the assignment specification PDF. It contains all of the
important information regarding the assessment. The remainder of this README
has a few reminders.

It should be evident from your submission (to Gradescope) if something has gone
wrong, as the autograder will fail your tests. Please check the structure of
your submitted .zip file matches the expected one as mentioned above before
trying again.

Please direct questions to Ed, and attend the assignment help sessions
where applicable.

Don't forget: the `test_*` programs are for your own use and we do not use
them when marking your assignment. As such, you are not bound by the
programming rules set out in the spec when implementing your own tests.
Don't be afraid to check your solutions against "canonical" python code.
